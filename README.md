# atlas-unity-assets

Technical Description

This project encapsulates multiple key areas:

    1. Unity Editor Customization: Learn to extend Unity’s built-in Editor by adding custom menus and submenus, making your tool easily accessible.
    2. Custom Assets Creation: Understand how to create custom assets using ScriptableObjects
    3. User Interface & Feedback: Develop skills to create intuitive Editor interfaces, handle user inputs, and provide feedback, ensuring a smooth user experience.
    4. Data Organization, Persistence and Save System Implementation: Organize and persist data using Unity’s Editor Preferences or ScriptableObjects, with a focus on handling items.
    5. Factory Design Pattern: Evolve your codebase throughout the tasks as you encounter ways to reuse code (through abstract classes) and evolve your capabilities.

The system you create will allow developers to manage custom items efficiently within the Unity Editor.

Learning Objectives;

    The process of extending the Unity Editor with custom menus and windows.
    The creation and manipulation of ScriptableObjects as custom asset types.
    How to handle user input and feedback within the Editor UI.
